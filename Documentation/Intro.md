BookGen is a command line toolchain for writing books and documentation in markdown. It was inspired by GitBook. Generaly speeking you can call it a static website generator, but it has some neat features compared to other products.

It is designed to be cross platform, but It's developed and tested under Windows. The Editor uses WPF, so it's not portable.

* MIT Licensed
* Written in C#, targets .NET Core 3.1
* Extremely fast, compared to GitBook and other NodeJs stuff
* Many output formats: 
    * Static website with Bootstrap template
    * Printable or Word processor importable plain HTML

    * Wordpress compatible XML export file
