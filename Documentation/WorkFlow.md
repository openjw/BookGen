# Bookgen Workflow

BookGen is designed to be a command line e-book compiler. The basic workflow consists of the following steps:

* Create a folder
* Create a Table of contents markdown file, that includes all the chapters in your book.
* Write the book / Create the files for the chapters
* Create a bookgen.json configuration file (See section Configuration)
* Build / Test your book
* Enjoy result :)
