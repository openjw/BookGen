# BookGen - A C# documentation generator

Bookgen is inspired by Gitbook. Mainly I wrote it, because Node.js development is not my world.

Features:
 
* Lightweight code base
* Uses MarkDig that support a lot of markdown features
* Easily extensible templates
* Built in debug web server
* Single bookgen.json configuration (if run without arguments, creates default configuration)
* Customizeable

## Development Requirements

* Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Core configured for .NET Core Development
* .NET Core 2.2 SDK

## Documentation

The Documentation  of the program can be found [here](https://github.com/webmaster442/BookGen/blob/dotnetcore/Documentation/Index.md)
