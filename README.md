# BookGen - A C# documentation generator

Bookgen is inspired by Gitbook. Mainly I wrote it, because Node.js development is not my world.

* Lightweight code base
* Uses MarkDig that support a lot of markdown features
* Easily extensible templates
* Built in debug web server
* Single bookgen.json configuration
* Customizeable

* Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Core configured for .NET Core Development
* .NET Core 3.0 SDK
